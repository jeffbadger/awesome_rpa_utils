# Test Harness

The WinForms target app referenced throughout [TESTING.md](../TESTING.md)'s
Phase 0 — a small app with fixed, known control names so Pega Robot Studio
unit tests have something deterministic to point `DialogUtils`,
`KeyboardUtils`, `MouseUtils`, `WindowUtils`, and `UIAutomationUtils` at,
instead of relying on Notepad/Calculator (which vary by Windows version and,
for Notepad, use non-native WinUI3 dialogs).

This is a standalone project, deliberately kept outside `src/` and out of
`AwesomeRpaUtils.sln` — it's test tooling, not one of the shipped components.

## Building and running

Requires Windows (WinForms doesn't run headless). On a Windows machine with
the .NET 10 SDK:

```bash
dotnet run --project test-harness/TestHarness.csproj
```

It also compiles (but can't run) on non-Windows hosts via
`EnableWindowsTargeting`, so `dotnet build test-harness/TestHarness.csproj`
can still catch compile errors in CI or on a Linux dev machine.

## Controls

| Name | Type | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `btnClick` | Button | Click target for `MouseUtils`/`UIAutomationUtils.Invoke`; increments `lblClickCount` |
| `lblClickCount` | Label | Shows the running click count |
| `txtInput` | TextBox | Focused text field for `KeyboardUtils`/`UIAutomationUtils.SetValue`/`GetValue` |
| `chkOption` | CheckBox | Toggle target for `UIAutomationUtils.Toggle`/`IsToggled` |
| `lstItems` | ListBox (multi-select) | Scrollable, multi-selectable list for `MouseUtils` click/scroll/`ClickWithModifiers` |
| `treeSample` | TreeView | "Documents" node with two children, for `UIAutomationUtils.Expand`/`Collapse`/`Select` |
| `btnShowMessageBox` | Button | Opens a Yes/No `MessageBox` for `DialogUtils` |
| `btnOpenChildWindow` | Button | Opens `ChildForm` for `WindowUtils` child-window tests |

Each control's `Name` doubles as its Win32 window text lookup key and, for
standard WinForms controls, its UI Automation `AutomationId` — though per
`UIAutomationUtils`' own README caveat, this mapping isn't guaranteed for
every control type, so verify the actual `AutomationId` Robot Studio sees
before writing a test case against it.
